## ✨ Why Asspp?

- **🌍 Multi-Region Access**: Browse and search the US, Japan, China, or any other App Store region seamlessly. No more switching system accounts just to check an app.

- **📦 IPA Management**: Download official, signed IPAs directly from Apple's servers for backup or sideloading.
- **⏪ History Versions**: Need an older version of an app? Asspp makes it easy to find and download previous releases.
- **📱 Cross-Platform**: Native experience on both **iOS** and **macOS**.

## 📥 Installation

### iOS

#### Option 1: Auto-Build & Sign (Recommended)

Fork this repository to automatically build and sign the app with your own developer certificate. This gives you a permanent **OTA installation link** that stays up-to-date with the latest changes.

👉 **[Setup Guide](./Resources/Document/FORK_AUTOBUILD_GUIDE.md)**

#### Option 2: Manual Install

1.  Download the latest `.ipa` from [Releases](https://github.com/Lakr233/Asspp/releases).
2.  Sign and install using your preferred tool (e.g., SideStore, AltStore, TrollStore, or other signing service).

### macOS

1.  Download the latest `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Lakr233/Asspp/releases).
2.  Unzip and move `Asspp.app` to your Applications folder.
3.  **First Run and Trusting the App (Recommended)**:
    1.  Try double-clicking to open the app. If you see "App can’t be opened because the developer cannot be verified" or a similar message:
        - In Finder, locate `Asspp.app`, **Control-click** (or right-click) the app and choose **Open**, then click **Open** again in the dialog. This will create a one-time trust exception for the app.
    2.  If Control-clicking does not work or the app is still blocked:
        - Open **System Settings** -> **Privacy & Security** (or System Preferences -> Security & Privacy on older macOS). In the General/Security section, look for the blocked app and click **Open Anyway** or **Allow**. You may need to enter an administrator password.
    3.  Recommendation: Download from this repository's Releases and verify the release details to ensure the source is trusted before trusting and opening the app.

    > These steps follow macOS Gatekeeper practices and help minimize security risks while allowing you to run unsigned or self-signed apps.

## 🛠 Requirements

- **iOS**: iOS 17.0 or later.
- **macOS**: macOS 15.0 or later.
- **Apple ID**: Required to communicate with App Store APIs.

## 🚨 Special Notice

Asspp utilizes the same underlying communication protocol as `ipatool`. According to community speculation (unverified), previous outages of this protocol were likely caused by:
1. Widespread usage triggering Apple's risk control mechanisms.
2. Protocol modifications following the patching of an iCloud security vulnerability.
3. Adjustments to Apple's front-end gateways, which now enforce stricter traffic allocation and request validation.

Given the increasingly strict management of these APIs, **if the protocol becomes invalid again in the future, this project may not be able to provide further fixes.**

**⚠️ Important Security Warnings:**
1. **Protect your GUID:** Please treat your device GUID as a highly sensitive password. Never share or leak it to anyone.
2. **Do NOT use your primary Apple ID:** We strongly advise using a secondary or burner account with this tool. If your account is banned by Apple, it could potentially result in an unremovable Activation Lock on your device (while there are no confirmed cases of this happening yet, we cannot make any guarantees).
